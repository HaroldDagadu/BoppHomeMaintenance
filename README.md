Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Create a .env file for React:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Update the API URL:

bash
Copy code

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

API Documentation
The API endpoints are documented in the Django REST Framework's browsable API. To access it, run the Django development server and go to:
